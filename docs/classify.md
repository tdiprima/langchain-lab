I'll analyze the uploaded Python files and check if any of them implement Agentic RAG. Let me start by reviewing their contents.

### **Analysis of Uploaded Python Files for Agentic RAG**

After reviewing the files, **none of them fully implement Agentic RAG**, but some come close. Here's the breakdown:

1. **`chat_with_memory.py`**  
   - Uses **LangChain's memory** to maintain chat history.  
   - Implements a conversational AI that persists history across sessions.  
   - **NOT Agentic RAG**, since it lacks dynamic retrieval, reasoning agents, or external tool use.

2. **`check_OpenAIEmbeddings.py`**  
   - Initializes OpenAI Embeddings and FAISS vector store.  
   - Stores documents in FAISS but **does not retrieve or process them dynamically**.  
   - **NOT Agentic RAG**, as it only sets up a vector DB.

3. **`spy_agent_rag.py`**  
   - Implements **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** using OpenAI embeddings and FAISS.  
   - Retrieves relevant documents and generates responses.  
   - **Almost there, but NOT Agentic RAG**, because it lacks **agentic behavior** (i.e., multi-step reasoning, external tool use, or dynamic retrieval adjustments).

4. **`simple_qa.py`**  
   - Basic LLM-based Q&A system with a static prompt.  
   - **NOT RAG at all**, just a direct query-response system.

### **Closest to Agentic RAG?**
ðŸ“Œ **`spy_agent_rag.py` is the closest**, since it retrieves relevant information and generates answers. However, to make it **Agentic RAG**, it needs:
1. **Agentic Decision-Making** â€“ The system should **adapt its retrieval strategy** based on the query context.  
2. **Multi-Step Reasoning** â€“ Instead of retrieving once, it should refine searches iteratively.  
3. **Tool Use** â€“ It should interact with external sources like a medical database or API.

### **How to Upgrade `spy_agent_rag.py` to Agentic RAG?**
Here's how you can improve it:

âœ… **Add an agent framework** (e.g., LangChain's agent).  
âœ… **Enable tool use**, such as a real-time API fetch for classified info.  
âœ… **Use multi-step retrieval** rather than a single query-response cycle.  

Would you like me to modify it into a **true Agentic RAG example**? ðŸš€

I'll modify `spy_agent_rag.py` to implement **Agentic RAG**. The new version will:
1. **Use an agent** to reason through the query instead of just retrieving once.
2. **Incorporate external tools**, like a live API lookup.
3. **Perform multi-step retrieval** where the agent refines its search dynamically.

[spy\_agent_rag1.py](spy_agent_rag1.py)

I've modified the original `spy_agent_rag.py` into a true **Agentic RAG** system. Now, the agent:

âœ… Uses a **retriever tool** to fetch intelligence data.  
âœ… Calls an **external API tool** to get real-time spy network updates.  
âœ… Dynamically reasons over the retrieved information before responding.
