Llama3 says: Did you know that there is a giant storm on Jupiter that has been raging for at least 187 years?
The Great Red Spot, as it's called, is a persistent anticyclonic storm on Jupiter, which means it's a high-pressure region 
with clockwise rotation. It's so large that three Earths could fit inside it, and it's still visible from Earth with the help of telescopes!
