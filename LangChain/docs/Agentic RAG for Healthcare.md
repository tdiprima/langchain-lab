### **Agentic RAG for Healthcare**
Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Agentic RAG) extends traditional RAG by embedding reasoning and decision-making capabilities into the retrieval process. Instead of just fetching relevant documents and generating responses, Agentic RAG incorporates **agents** that can take actions, use external APIs, and refine their retrieval strategies based on the task at hand.

In healthcare, this means:

- **Dynamic Retrieval**: Instead of statically retrieving a set of documents, the system iteratively refines its search based on patient data, clinical guidelines, and past interactions.
- **Multi-Step Reasoning**: It breaks down complex medical queries into smaller steps, ensuring accuracy.
- **Tool Use**: It can fetch real-time medical knowledge (e.g., drug interactions, latest clinical guidelines) via APIs.

### **Example Use Case: Medication Recommendation for a Diabetic Patient**
Let's say a doctor wants to know **which medication to prescribe for a diabetic patient with kidney issues**. A basic RAG system would just retrieve medical documents. But **Agentic RAG** would:

1. Retrieve general diabetes treatment guidelines.
2. Cross-check for contraindications with kidney disease.
3. Fetch real-time FDA-approved drugs from an external API.
4. Provide a tailored recommendation.

---

### **Simple Code Example**
Below is a Python example using `langchain` with OpenAI + an external drug interaction API.

#### **Steps in Code**

1. Use a retriever to get general diabetes guidelines.
2. Use an agent to check for kidney-related contraindications.
3. Fetch current medication guidelines via an API.
4. Generate a final recommendation.

[diabetes.py](diabetes.py)

### **What Happens Here?**

1. The **agent searches** for diabetes treatment guidelines (`retrieve_medical_guidelines`).
2. It **checks contraindications** for kidney disease (`contraindication_checker`).
3. The **LLM processes** the retrieved information and **generates a personalized response**.

### **Example Output**

```
Based on current guidelines, Metformin is typically avoided in patients with kidney disease.
Alternative medications such as DPP-4 inhibitors (e.g., Sitagliptin) or SGLT2 inhibitors
may be considered. Please consult a specialist.
```

### **Why Agentic RAG Works Well in Healthcare**
âœ… **More accurate than traditional RAG** (it reasons over retrieved data).  
âœ… **Adaptive** (it adjusts based on real-time external sources).  
âœ… **Reduces errors** (cross-checking for contraindications).  

Would this example work for your needs, or do you want a different healthcare scenario? ðŸš‘ðŸ’¡

### **Agentic RAG for Healthcare â€“ Example 2: Diagnosing a Patient with Symptoms**  
Instead of just retrieving documents, we'll create an **agentic workflow** where the AI:  
1. **Retrieves medical literature** on the reported symptoms.  
2. **Checks symptom-disease databases** via an API.  
3. **Suggests a possible diagnosis and recommends tests** based on standard clinical guidelines.

---

### **Scenario**:  
A doctor inputs:  
*"A 55-year-old male presents with fatigue, weight loss, and excessive thirst. What could be the cause?"*

**Agentic RAG Process:**  
âœ… Retrieve medical guidelines on fatigue, weight loss, and thirst.  
âœ… Query an external **symptom-disease database API**.  
âœ… Generate an AI-assisted **diagnosis hypothesis** and suggest tests.

### **Code Implementation**:
Here's a **LangChain-based** solution using **agent tools**:

[diagnose.py](diagnose.py)

### **How This is Agentic RAG**  
ðŸ”¹ **Multi-Step Retrieval**: The AI first fetches medical knowledge, then queries an external API.  
ðŸ”¹ **Agent Reasoning**: It **interprets** results instead of just retrieving data.  
ðŸ”¹ **Tool Use**: Calls an API to cross-check symptoms and suggests lab tests.  

### **Example Output**  

```
Possible causes include diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, or dehydration.
Recommended tests: Blood glucose, HbA1c, thyroid function panel, and kidney function tests.
Consult an endocrinologist if results indicate metabolic disease.
```
