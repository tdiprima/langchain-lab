```python
# chains_example.py
chain = prompt | llm
```

This line uses the `|` (pipe) operator, which is a feature of the **LangChain Expression Language (LCEL)** introduced by LangChain. This is a concise way to define a sequence of operations—essentially a chain—where the output of one component is passed as the input to the next. It's a more modern and streamlined syntax compared to older LangChain approaches.

### Is this a `RunnableSequence`?
Yes, under the hood, the `|` operator creates a `RunnableSequence`! Specifically, when you use `|` to connect a `PromptTemplate` (like `prompt`) and an LLM (like `llm`), LangChain interprets this as a sequence of "runnables" that should be executed in order. A `RunnableSequence` is a type of `Runnable` (a core abstraction in LCEL) that chains multiple steps together.

So, in your example:

- `prompt` is a `PromptTemplate`, which is a `Runnable` that takes input (e.g., `user_input`) and generates a formatted prompt string.
- `llm` is an `OpenAI` instance, also a `Runnable`, which takes the prompt string and generates a response.
- `prompt | llm` creates a `RunnableSequence` that first runs the `prompt` to format the input, then passes the result to the `llm` to get the final output.

You could explicitly write this as a `RunnableSequence` using the older, more verbose syntax like this:

```python
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnableSequence

chain = RunnableSequence(prompt, llm)
```

But the `|` operator is just syntactic sugar for the same thing—it's more readable and aligns with the LCEL philosophy of making chains feel like a pipeline.

### Why the Confusion?
The confusion likely comes from the fact that older LangChain tutorials or docs might use explicit classes like `LLMChain` (now considered legacy) or manually construct sequences without the `|` operator. For example:

```python
from langchain.chains import LLMChain

chain = LLMChain(prompt=prompt, llm=llm)
```

`LLMChain` was the traditional way to combine a prompt and an LLM, but it's been largely replaced by LCEL and `RunnableSequence` in newer versions of LangChain for greater flexibility and consistency. The `|` operator is part of this newer LCEL approach.

### How Does It Work?
When you call `chain.invoke({"user_input": question})`:

1. The `prompt` takes the `user_input` ("My name is Bear. Can you greet me?") and formats it into a full prompt string based on the template:  

   ```
   You are a friendly assistant. Respond to the user by name.
   User: My name is Bear. Can you greet me?
   Assistant:
   ```

2. This string is then passed to the `llm`, which generates the response:  

   ```
   Hello Bear, it's nice to meet you! How can I assist you today?
   ```

The `|` operator ensures this flow happens seamlessly.

### Key Takeaway
Yes, `chain = prompt | llm` creates a `RunnableSequence` implicitly using LCEL. It's not "something else"—it's just a modern, concise way to define a chain in LangChain. If you're digging into the docs or source code, you'll see `RunnableSequence` as the underlying type when you inspect `chain`.
